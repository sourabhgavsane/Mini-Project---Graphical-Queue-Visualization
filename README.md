# Mini-Project---Graphical-Queue-Visualization
Hello, In this mini project, I have Implemented a graphical application that allows users to interact with a queue. Users can enqueue (add) and dequeue (remove) elements from the queue, and the operations will be visually displayed on the screen.

##Requirements:
Python (3.x recommended)
tkinter library (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
A code editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm)

##Project Description:
In this mini project, you will create a graphical application that allows users to interact with a queue. Users can enqueue (add) and dequeue (remove) elements from the queue, and the operations will be visually displayed on the screen.

##Project Steps:

1.	Set Up the GUI: Create a graphical user interface (GUI) using tkinter. Set up a window with buttons to enqueue and dequeue elements, as well as an area to display the current state of the queue.
2.	Implement the Queue: Implement a basic queue data structure using a list in Python. You can create functions for enqueue and dequeue operations.
3.	Connect GUI to Queue: Link the GUI buttons to the queue operations. When the user clicks "Enqueue," add an element to the queue, and when they click "Dequeue," remove an element.
4.	Visualize the Queue: As elements are enqueued and dequeued, update the GUI to display the current state of the queue. You can use labels or a canvas to represent the queue elements.
5.	Test the Application: Run the application and test the enqueue and dequeue operations. Ensure that the graphical representation of the queue updates as expected.
6.	User-Friendly Features: You can add additional features like input fields for the elements to enqueue, error handling for dequeue when the queue is empty, and a button to clear the queue.

##Sample Code Structure:
Here's a basic outline of how your code structure might look:
Python :

import tkinter as tk
# Queue implementation
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop(0)
        else:
            return None

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

# GUI setup
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Graphical Queue Visualization")

# Create GUI elements (buttons, labels, canvas, etc.)

# Define queue variable
queue = Queue
Python code for Graphical Queue Visualization :
Creating a graphical queue visualization in Python using the tkinter library is a fun project. Below is a basic example of Python code for a graphical queue visualization. This code provides a simple GUI where you can enqueue and dequeue elements from a queue, and it visually represents the state of the queue using tkinter.

In this code:
1)	We create a tkinter window with a canvas to display the queue.
2)	The user can input elements to enqueue and use the "Enqueue" and "Dequeue" buttons.
3)	The queue data structure is implemented, and the visualization is updated after each enqueue or dequeue operation.
4)	When dequeuing, a messagebox displays the dequeued item.
5)	Error handling is provided for empty input or an empty queue.

Thank You! 
Happy Learning :)
